# SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio
Goal - Showcasing Data Analysis and Visualization skills using MySQL and PowerBI

Welcome to my personal SQL-PowerBI repository. Here you will find a collection of MySQL and PowerBI projects, showcasing my skills in data manipulation and analysis using MySQL and creating interactive dashboards using PowerBI 

# SQL and PowerBI Projects

Here is the overview of the projects:

1. [HR Absenteeism analysis](https://github.com/Trevor20/SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Project1-HRAbsenteesim) - This project explores patterns and factors that contribute to absenteeism in the workplace. The fictitious HR also wanted to reward employees with healthy lifestyle to promote healthy living. Data relevant to the analysis and HR requirements was extracted using SQL and the final dataset was presented using interactive dashboards in Power BI.

2. [Airport Air Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/Trevor20/SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Project2-AirportAnalysis) - This project analyzes the air travel trends in The US from 2000 to 2009. It presents insights into passenger traffic over the years, flight occupancy and popular routes. The dataset was taken from Kraggle and contains over 2 million datapoints. The dataset was cleaned, processed and presented using interactive dashboards in Power BI.

3. [Flight booking Analysis](https://github.com/Trevor20/SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Project3-FlightBookingAnalysis) - This project analyzes airline bookings to uncover insights about popular routes, customer preferences and booking trends. It contains 50k datapoints of routes from around the world. The dataset was cleaned and initial analysis was done on SQL. The cleaned data was connected to Power BI to create interactive dashboards.

4. [Real Estate Analysis](https://github.com/Trevor20/SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Project4-RealEstateAnalysis) - This project analyzes real estate listings in the UAE as of 2024 to uncover insights on apartment charteristics across major cities in the UAE, price patters and apartment listings trends over time. The dataset was cleaned and processed on SQL and final analysis was presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard using DAX

5. [Coffee Retail Sales Analysis](https://github.com/Trevor20/SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Project5-CoffeeRetailAnalysis) - This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover insights on customer behavior, discount patterns, and store performance. The dataset was processed using an ETL pipeline in SQL, where data was loaded from CSV files, cleaned and structured into a star schema for efficient querying. The final analysis was presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard, leveraging DAX measures to visualize sales trends, top products, and profitability.
