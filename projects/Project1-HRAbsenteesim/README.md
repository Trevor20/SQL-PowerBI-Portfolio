# Analysing Employee Absenteeism using SQL and Power BI

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyses workplace absenteeism using employee demographics, lifestyle choices and compensation data. Furthermore, the HR department is looking to promote a healthy workforce through incentive programs like a bonus. Specifically, they aim to identify healthy employees with low absenteeism for a health bonus and evaluate compensation adjustments for non-smokers.

Data was cleaned and analysed using SQL, and key trends and insights was visualized and presented in Power BI through interactive dashboards.

## 🧠 Business Problem

Employee absenteeism directly affects productivity and efficiency. The HR department wants to understand the major reasons of absenteeism and identify areas where intervention - through wellness programs and compensation changes - can reduce unplanned leave and encourage healthier employee behaviour.

## 🎯 Objectives 

1. HR wants the following information for their incentive programs
   - Provide a list of healthy individuals and low absenteeism for a health bonus program.
   - Calculate wage increase for non-smokers - budget $983,221
2. Develop a Power BI dashboard to help HR understand key absenteeism patterns accross time, demographics and lifestyle
   - Absenteeism Overview - Key trends, Absenteeism Distribution and top reasons for being absent 
   - Absenteeism Factors - Analysis of how compensation, disciplinary failure and social lifestyle (Smoker, Drinker, BMI and no of degrees, pets and children) impact absenteeism.

## 📖 Dataset

The dataset includes information on:
- Demographics: Age, education, BMI, children, pets
- Compensation: Compensation per hour
- Lifestyle: Smoking, drinking habits
- Absenteeism: Reasons, number of hours, days of the week, and months

The data is anonymized and provided in CSV format. The dataset has 740 records.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- MySQL - For data cleaning, joins and transformations using SQL queries and views
- Power BI - For interactive dashboard creation and data visualization
- DAX - For calculated measures, KPIs and time-based metrics
- Data Modelling - Star schema and relationship setup between data tables

## 📁 Database

The database was created in MySQL and the dataset was imported. The questions from HR was answered using SQL queries. A View was created in MySQL with relevant data required for absenteeism analysis. The view was connected to Power BI and an interactive dashboard was created.

## 📂 Database Structure
