# Analysing Employee Absenteeism using SQL and Power BI

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project analyses workplace absenteeism using employee demographics, lifestyle choices and compensation data. Furthermore, the HR department is looking to promote a healthy workforce through incentive programs like a bonus. Specifically, they aim to identify healthy employees with low absenteeism for a health bonus and evaluate compensation adjustments for non-smokers.

Data was cleaned and analysed using SQL, and key trends and insights was visualized and presented in Power BI through interactive dashboards.

## üß† Business Problem

Employee absenteeism directly affects productivity and efficiency. The HR department wants to understand the major reasons of absenteeism and identify areas where intervention - through wellness programs and compensation changes - can reduce unplanned leave and encourage healthier employee behaviour.

## üéØ Objectives 

1. HR wants the following information for their incentive programs
   - Provide a list of healthy individuals and low absenteeism for a health bonus program.
   - Calculate wage increase for non-smokers - budget $983,221
2. Develop a Power BI dashboard to help HR understand key absenteeism patterns accross time, demographics and lifestyle
   - Absenteeism Overview - Key trends, Absenteeism Distribution and top reasons for being absent 
   - Absenteeism Factors - Analysis of how compensation, disciplinary failure and social lifestyle (Smoker, Drinker, BMI and no of degrees, pets and children) impact absenteeism.

## üìñ Dataset

The dataset includes information on:
- Demographics: Age, education, BMI, children, pets
- Compensation: Compensation per hour
- Lifestyle: Smoking, drinking habits
- Absenteeism: Reasons, number of hours, days of the week, and months

The data is anonymized and provided in CSV format. The dataset has 740 records.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- MySQL - For data cleaning, joins and transformations using SQL queries and views
- Power BI - For interactive dashboard creation and data visualization
- DAX - For calculated measures, KPIs and time-based metrics
- Data Modelling - Star schema and relationship setup between data tables

## üìÅ Database

The database was created in MySQL and the dataset was imported. The questions from HR was answered using SQL queries. A View was created in MySQL with relevant data required for absenteeism analysis. The view was connected to Power BI and an interactive dashboard was created.

## üìÇ Database Structure

Three tables were created in MySQL" 

### 1. Compensation
| Column  | Description                    |
|---------|--------------------------------|

8. Does BMI impact absenteeism?

## ‚û°Ô∏è Project Approach

### 1. Data extract, transform and load using SQL
1. Data from CSV files was loaded into MySQL using Table Data Import Wizard.
2. Questions from HR was answered using SELECT and JOIN.
3. A VIEW was created with relevant data needed for absenteeism analysis.
4. Connected Power BI to MySQL using Direct Query to create interactive dashboards.

### 2. Data Transformation and Visualatization Using Power BI
The dashboard has the following main Attributes
1. Page 1 - Overview
      - KPI - Summary of relevent KPIs like total employees, average time absent, % of employees who smoke and/or drink, etc
      - Time-series analysis - tracks when do employees take leaves
      - Employee demographics - Determines employee body factors (BMI, age) that tend to take more leaves
      - Top reasons - table that indicates the top reasons employees be absent
3. Page 2 - Absent Factors
     - Work factors - graphs that indicate whether disciplinary failure and compensation/hr are related to absenteeism
     - Social factors - Donut charts that provide insights into what social factors like no of education degrees, children and pets affect absenteeism
     - Health factors - Column charts that indicade whether BMI or smoker/drink affect absenteeism 

## üèÜ Final Insights
