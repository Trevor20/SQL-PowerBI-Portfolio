# Real Estate Analysis in The UAE Using SQL and Power BI

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project analyzes real estate listings data using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for interactive visualizations. The goal is to derive insights into listing characteristics across different cities in the UAE, listing and price trends over time.

## üéØ Objectives 

- Analyse listing patters during the day and during the week
- Evaluate apartment characeristics across major cities in the UAE
- Study price trends as apartment characteristics change
- Analyse distribution of apartment listings across the UAE to understand where most apartments are located

## üìñ Dataset

The dateset in this project contains information about apartment listings in UAE. The dataset was initially collected from Kraggle, which contained imformation about listings posted on different listing sites. The dataset includes information like apartment location, date posted and characteristics of the apartment like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished or unfurnished, etc

## üìÅ Database

To facilitate data management and analysis, a database on MySQL was created to store the dataset. MySQL provdies a robust method to organize and manipulate data. A database schema was created to improve organization and efficiency of queries. The structure allows easy integration with tools like Power BI for visualsation.

## üìÇ Database Structure

The final Dataset contains 2 tables 

### 1. Location
| Column   | Description                             |

| Loc_Id   | Unique Address Id                       |
| City     | City the apartment is located           |
| District | District where the apartment is located |

## ‚û°Ô∏è Project Approach

### 1. Extract, Transform, Load, and Analysis using MySQL
1. Created a SQL database and tables, and loaded data from CSV files into the database using Table Data Import Wizard. 
2. Cleaned data by replacing redundant text-based values with Unique ids to initiate faster querying through relational joins.
4. Added primary and foreign keys to build a star-schema like relational design
5. Conducted initial data analysis using SQL queries, including CTEs and Joins.

### 2. Data Visualatization Using Power BI
Connected Power BI to MySQL Database through Direct Query and build the following visuals
1. Overview - Summary of relevant KPIs like total listings, percentage verified, price per sqft, etc.
2. City Analysis - table and graphs that show the average characteristics and total listings across cities in UAE
3. Time-series analysis - graphs that show the no of listings added over time, allows the viewer to see times when website is most active
4. Price trends - To study how price changes with changes in apartment characteristics like apartment type, furnishing and no of bedrooms
5. Listing analysis - to determine how many listings are verfied, and how do they change as apartment type changes. It also determines distribution of listings according to no of bedrooms and apartment type

## üèÜ Final Insights
- Only listings in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are verified, with Dubai having the majority of verfied listings.
- Monday, start of the week, has the most listings added.
- Most of the listings are added around morning from 7 am to 12 pm.
- Area seems to increase approximately linearly with no of bedrooms.
- Studio, 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom make up for majority of the listings.
