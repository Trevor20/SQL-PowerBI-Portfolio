# Air Traffic Analysis in USA from 2000-2009 using Power BI

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing air traffic across the US from 2000 to 2009. It presents key insights into passenger traffic, flight occupancy, route popularity and state-wise aire travel distribution. It helps stakeholders understand travel demand, airport performance, and flight patterns over the years.

## [Report](https://github.com/Trevor20/SQL-PowerBI-Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Project2-AirportAnalysis/report)

## üéØ Objectives 

- Analyse passenger traffic trends over the years
- Evaluate route and airport popularity
- Assess seat utilization and efficiency
- Assess most common flight purposes
- Gather popularity of regions within the US by analysing total incoming and outgoing passenger traffic

## üìñ Dataset

The dateset in this project contains information about air travel. The dataset was initially collected from Kraggle and contains over 2 million datapoints. The dataset includes information like flight date, total flights, route, total passengers, empty seats, etc.

## üìÅ Database

To Dataset was directly imported into Power BI. The dataset was cleaned in Power Query by removing redundance columns and empty rows. A new table called routes was created that contained information about airport location and population of the city it was located

## üìÇ Database Structure

The Database contains 1 table

### 1. Airport_Data
| Column                 | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Origin_Airport         | Airport from which the plane departed (IATA 3 character format)|
| Destination_Airport    | Airport to which the plane landed (IATA 3 Character format)    |
| Origin_City            | City in which the departure airport is located                 |
| Destination_City       | City in which arrival airport is located                       |
| Passengers             | Total passengers who travelled                                 |
| Seats                  | Total available seats                                          |
| Flights                | Total number of flights that travelled that route on that date |
| Distance               | Distance from origin to destination                            |
| Fly_Date               | Date the flight took place                                     |
| Origin_population      | Population of the city where the origin airport is located     |
| Destination_population | Population of the city where the destination airport is located|
| Org_airport_lat        | Latitude of the origin airport                                 |
| Org_airport_Long       | Longitude of the origin airport                                |
| Dest_airport_lat       | Latitude of the origin airport                                 |
| Dest_airport_long      | Longitude of the origin airport                                |

## üîç Key Business Questions Answered

1. How has total passenger traffic evolved between 2000 and 20009?
2. Which 5 airports handled the highest passenger traffic?
3. What are the top 5 most popular flight routes based on total passengers?
4. What percentage of seats remained empty on flights over the years?
5. How many empty seats per flight were recorded on average?
6. What is the distribution of flights by purpose (commercial, cargo, other)?
7. Which 10 states had the highest passenger traffic (incoming and outgoing)?

## ‚û°Ô∏è Project Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation using Power Query in Power BI
1. Since latitude and longitude columns had many empty rows and Origin/destination city existed, having both latitude/longitude and city information is redundance. So, latitude/longitude columns were removed.
2. Created a new table Airports with information that were constant like airport name, city and population. Removed the columns in airport_data that existed in airports table
3. Since city columns contained states too, the city columns were split into city and state. Another column country was added to ensure Power BI knows cities are restricted to the US.
4. Added a new column routes with format as origin_airport-->destination_airport to analyse popular routes.
5. Added a new column purpose that indicates the purpose of the flight. Flights with 0 passenger tend to be cargo flights, while flights with at least 1 passenger tend to be commercial.

### 1. Data Visualatization Using Power BI
Created the following main sections of the dashboard to gather insights
1. Overview - Summary of relevant KPIs like total passengers, longest route, % unoccupied seats per flight, flight distance per route, etc
2. Time-series analysis - tracks how passenger traffic evolved over the years
3. Airport popularity - graphs that highlight the busiest airports an popular flight routes
4. Market trends - Donut chart that indicates the most common purpose of travel
5. Region wise analysis - Heatmap that indicates top states in the US that have the most passenger traffic (incoming and outgoing)

## üèÜ Final Insights
- Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) to (Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) is the most popular route.
-  Average flight distance is 653.59 nautical miles.
-  There are about 27 unoccupied seats per flight.
-  Over 10 years, there are 2037 flights per route.
-  Passenger traffic had a steep increase till 2007 and then dramatically reduced from 2007-2009. This could be due to the financial crises of 2008
-  Over 95% of flights were commercial.
-  California, texas and florida had the most passenger traffic.
