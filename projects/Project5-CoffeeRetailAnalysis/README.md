## 📖 Dataset

The dateset in this project contains sales information of a coffe retail store in Saudi Arabia. The dataset was initially collected from Kraggle, which contained sales data and location of the stores. Additional tables like detailed product, store and customer information was created by me using fictional data and research of approx profit margin of coffee. The added information creates complexity in data analysis. The dataset includes information like transaction date, sales quantity, gross sales, discounts and net sales.
