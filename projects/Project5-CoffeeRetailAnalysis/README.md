## ‚û°Ô∏è Project Approach

### 1. Extract, Transform, Load, and Analysis using MySQL
1. Created a SQL database and loaded the CSV datasets using Table Data Import Wizard. 
2. Cleaned data by addressing incorrect date formats, replaced redundant text-based values with Unique ids to initiate faster querying through relational joins.
3. Deleted unnecessary columns to increase efficiency of data structure.
4. Build a star schema with primary and foreign key relationships.
5. Conducted initial data analysis using SQL queries, including CTEs, Joins and window functions.

### 2. Data Visualatization Using Power BI
Connected Power BI to MySQL Database via Direct Query and built the following visuals
1. Overview - Summary of relevant KPIs like total sales, best product and best store.
2. Product analysis - To understand demand, amount sold and gross profils accross different coffee brands.
3. Time-series analysis - Visuals that show monthly and weekday transaction patterns.
