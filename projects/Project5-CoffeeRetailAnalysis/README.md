# Coffee Retail Sales Analysis in Saudi Arabia Using SQL and Power BI

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project analyzes coffee retail sales data using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for interactive visualizations. The goal is to derive insights into sales performance, discount impact and customer behavior.

## üéØ Objectives 

- Analyze sales trends and identify top-performing products & stores
- Examine the impact of discounts on net sales & profit margins
- Evaluate customer purchasing behavior across different demographics
- Measure store performance based on sales, employees, and management

## üìñ Dataset

The dateset in this project contains sales information of a coffe retail store in Saudi Arabia. The dataset was initially collected from Kraggle, which contained sales data and location of the stores. Additional tables like detailed product, store and customer information was created by me using fictional data and research of approx profit margin of coffee. The added information creates complexity in data analysis. The dataset includes information like transaction date, sales quantity, gross sales, discounts and net sales.

## üìÅ Database

To facilitate data management and analysis, a database on MySQL was created to store the dataset. MySQL provdies a robust method to organize and manipulate data. A database schema was created to improve organization and efficiency of queries. The structure allows easy integration with tools like Power BI for visualsation.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Project Approach

### 1. Extract, Transform, Load, and Analysis using MySQL
1. Created a SQL database and tables, and loaded data from CSV files into the database using Table Data Import Wizard. 
2. Cleaned data by addressing incorrect date formats, replaced redundant text-based values with Unique ids to initiate faster querying through relational joins.
3. Deleted unnecessary columns to increase efficiency of data structure.
4. Added primary and foreign keys to build a star-schema like relational design
5. Conducted initial data analysis using SQL queries, including CTEs, Joins and window functions.

### 2. Data Visualatization Using Power BI
Connected Power BI to MySQL Database through Direct Query and build the following visuals
1. Overview - Summary of relevant KPIs like total sales, best product and best store
2. Product analysis - Understand the distribution of demand, amount sold and gross profils accross different coffee brands
3. Time-series analysis - graphs that show the transactions over time, allows the viewer to see peak hours/days
4. Store analysis - To compared managers performance across stores
5. Customer analysis - To understand most popular products and where gender had an impact on discounts and sales 

## üèÜ Final Insights
- Monday and Friday has the most rush for coffee, probably due to the fact that those are the start and end of the work week
- There doesnt seem to be a significant difference in net sales and profit across all stores, all stores have gross profit close to the overall average 
- Colombian coffee is the most popular while Hail is the city with most transactions
- Net sales increases as total discount increases. This indicates that providing discounts at the right time is beneficial to the overall sales
