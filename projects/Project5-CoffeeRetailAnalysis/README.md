# Coffee Retail Sales Analysis in Saudi Arabia Using SQL and Power BI

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project analyzes coffee retail sales data using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for interactive visualizations. The goal is to derive insights into sales performance, discount impact and customer behavior.

## üéØ Objectives 

- Analyze sales trends and identify top-performing products & stores
- Examine the impact of discounts on net sales & profit margins
- Evaluate customer purchasing behavior across different demographics
- Measure store performance based on sales, employees, and management

## üìñ Dataset

The dateset in this project contains sales information of a coffe retail store in Saudi Arabia. The dataset was initially collected from Kraggle, which contained sales data and location of the stores. Additional tables like detailed product, store and customer information was created by me using fictional data and research of approx profit margin of coffee. The added information creates complexity in data analysis. The dataset includes information like transaction date, sales quantity, gross sales, discounts and net sales.

## üìÅ Database

To facilitate data management and analysis, a database on MySQL was created to store the dataset. MySQL provdies a robust method to organize and manipulate data. A database schema was created to improve organization and efficiency of queries. The structure allows easy integration with tools like Power BI for visualsation.
